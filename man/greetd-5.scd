# NAME

greetd - configuration file

# DESCRIPTION

greetd uses a simple TOML configuration file to define its behavior.

# CONFIGURATION

The configuration is divided into *sections*. Sections are delimited like so:

```
[section_name]
config_key = value
```

Configuration keys can be integer literals, or quote-delimited strings. The
configuration sections are described below.

## terminal

This section contains terminal configuration.

*vt* = num|"next"|"current"
	The VT to run on. Can be the number of a specific VT, "next" to select the
	next available VT, or "current" to stay wherever greetd was started. The
	specific VT is evaluated at startup, and does not change during the execution
	of greetd.

	If using the current or a specific VT, you must ensure that there are no
	other users of that VT. If using systemd with autovt and getty, conflict
	avoidance can be handled in the service unit with
	"Conflicts=getty@ttyN.service", where N is the VT number.

	Use of a specific VT with appropriate conflict avoidance is recommended.

## default_session

This section describes the default session, also referred to as the *greeter*.

*command* = command-line
	The command-line to run to start the default session, e.g. "agreety -c sway".
	The default session is automatically started when no other session is
	running, such as when user session terminate, and when greetd is initially
	started with no initial session configured.

	See *greetd-ipc*(7) for information on how a greeter can create sessions.

*user* = user
	The user to use for running the greeter. Defaults to "greeter".

*session_type* = type
	The type of session to create for the default session. This should be set
	to "tty" for a text-mode greeter like agreety, or to "x11", "wayland",
	or "mir" for a graphical greeter. If a session type is not explicitly
	set, the value "unspecified" will be used.

## initial_session

This optional section describes the initial session, commonly referred to as
"auto-login".

*command* = command-line
	The command-line to run to start the initial session, e.g. "sway". The
	initial session will be run when exactly once when greetd is initially
	launched.

*user* = user
	The user to use for running the initial session.

*session_type* = type
	The type of session to create for the initial session. This should be set
	to "tty" if starting a shell, or to "x11", "wayland", or "mir" if launching
	a graphical session. If a session type is not explicitly set, the value
	"unspecified" will be used.

# EXAMPLES

## Regular setup with agreety and sway

```
[terminal]
vt = 1

[default_session]
command = "agreety -c sway"
session_type = "tty"
```

## Auto-login

```
[terminal]
vt = 1

[default_session]
command = "agreety -c sway"
session_type = "tty"

[initial_session]
command = "sway"
user = "john"
session_type = "wayland"
```
